Challenge: Shopping Cart Implementation
Instructions
1. Create a Base Class Product:
1.1 It should have private attributes __name, __price, and __stock_quantity.
1.2 It should have properties name, price, and stock_quantity to get and set the values of these attributes.
1.3 The price property should ensure that the price is not negative.
1.4 The stock_quantity property should ensure that the stock quantity is not negative.

2. Create a Class VirtualCart:
2.1 It should have a private attribute __products which is a dictionary where the key is the product name and the value is an instance of Product.
2.2 It should have a method add_product(product, quantity) that adds a product to the cart.
    - If the requested quantity exceeds the stock quantity, it should raise a custom exception InsufficientStockError.
2.3 It should have a method remove_product(product_name) that removes a product from the cart.
2.4 It should have a method calculate_total() that calculates and returns the total cost of the products in the cart.
2.5 It should have a method show_cart() that prints the products in the cart with their quantities and prices.

3. Testing and Verification:
3.1 Create several products, add them to the cart, handle exceptions if you try to add more than what is in stock, calculate the total of the cart, and remove a product."""
