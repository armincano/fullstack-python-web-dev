This is a variation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements,
and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Bubble Sort requires at most ( n-1 ) passes through the list,
where ( n ) is the number of elements in the list.
